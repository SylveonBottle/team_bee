# TF2: team_bee
The entire bee movie script, in tournament spam form.

Uses tournament_teamname to spam the bee movie in pre/post game.


Provided by an old friend, using his now-shutdown site at teamname.scriptis.net

To use, run `exec bee` in-game, then press `=` during pre-game or post-game.

It's normal to lag for a few seconds upon executing.
